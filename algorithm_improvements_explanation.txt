                    IMPROVED FASTERKAN ALGORITHM EXPLANATION
                    WiFi Indoor Localization Enhancement
================================================================================

1. OVERVIEW OF IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

Our improved FasterKAN model introduces several key enhancements over the original
paper's implementation to achieve better accuracy and lower positioning errors:

1.1 Multi-Head Attention Mechanism
1.2 Enhanced Architecture with Deeper Layers
1.3 Improved Reflectional Switch Activation Function (RSWAF)
1.4 Advanced Training Techniques
1.5 Residual Connections and Batch Normalization
1.6 Enhanced Data Preprocessing

2. DETAILED ALGORITHM IMPROVEMENTS
================================================================================

2.1 MULTI-HEAD ATTENTION MECHANISM
----------------------------------
Problem Addressed: The original FasterKAN doesn't capture spatial relationships
between different WiFi access points, which is crucial for indoor localization.

Solution: Added Multi-Head Attention layer that:
- Captures spatial correlations between WiFi signals
- Allows the model to focus on the most relevant access points
- Provides better feature representation through attention weights

Implementation Details:
- 8 attention heads for diverse feature extraction
- Scaled dot-product attention with learnable parameters
- Residual connections and layer normalization for stability
- Dropout (0.1) for regularization

Mathematical Formulation:
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
where Q, K, V are learned linear transformations of input features

2.2 ENHANCED ARCHITECTURE
-------------------------
Original Paper Architecture:
- Input Layer: 465 features
- Hidden Layer 1: 400 nodes
- Hidden Layer 2: 400 nodes  
- Output Layer: 2 nodes (coordinates)

Our Improved Architecture:
- Input Projection: 465 → 512 (with batch normalization)
- Multi-Head Attention: 512 features with 8 heads
- KAN Layer 1: 512 → 400 (with RSWAF)
- KAN Layer 2: 400 → 300 (with RSWAF)
- KAN Layer 3: 300 → 200 (with RSWAF)
- Output Layer: 200 → 100 → 2 (with batch normalization)

Key Improvements:
- Deeper architecture (6 layers vs 3 layers)
- Progressive dimension reduction for better feature learning
- Batch normalization for training stability
- Residual connections to prevent vanishing gradients

2.3 IMPROVED REFLECTIONAL SWITCH ACTIVATION FUNCTION (RSWAF)
------------------------------------------------------------
Original RSWAF:
- Fixed parameters (exponent=2, denominator=0.15)
- Static grid points
- No learnable scaling

Enhanced RSWAF:
- Learnable parameters: α, β, γ for adaptive scaling
- Dynamic grid point optimization
- Enhanced stability through parameter initialization

Mathematical Enhancement:
f(x) = γ * Σ exp(-β * (|αx - grid_i| / denominator)^exponent)

Where α, β, γ are learnable parameters that adapt during training.

2.4 ADVANCED TRAINING TECHNIQUES
--------------------------------
Original Training:
- Basic Adam optimizer
- Simple learning rate scheduling
- No gradient clipping

Enhanced Training:
- AdamW optimizer with weight decay (8e-2)
- ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler with patience=10
- Gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0) for stability
- Early stopping with patience=20
- Enhanced weight initialization (Xavier uniform)

Optimizer Configuration:
- Learning Rate: 8e-3 (same as paper)
- Weight Decay: 8e-2 (added for regularization)
- Beta parameters: (0.9, 0.999) for momentum
- Epsilon: 1e-8 for numerical stability

2.5 RESIDUAL CONNECTIONS AND BATCH NORMALIZATION
-----------------------------------------------
Residual Connections:
- Added skip connections between layers
- Prevents vanishing gradient problem
- Enables training of deeper networks
- Formula: output = F(x) + x (where F is the layer transformation)

Batch Normalization:
- Applied after each linear layer
- Normalizes inputs to each layer
- Accelerates training convergence
- Reduces internal covariate shift

2.6 ENHANCED DATA PREPROCESSING
-------------------------------
Original Preprocessing:
- Basic RSSI value replacement (-105 dBm for missing values)
- Simple MinMax scaling

Enhanced Preprocessing:
- Intelligent AP selection (removes constant/mostly missing APs)
- Statistical analysis for AP usefulness
- Enhanced missing value handling
- Improved scaling with outlier detection

AP Selection Criteria:
- Standard deviation > 0.1 (ensures variation)
- Missing rate < 80% (ensures sufficient data)
- Removes constant value access points
