=== WHY RESULTS ARE NOW BETTER ===

EXCELLENT RESULTS (UJI, SOD1, SOD2):
- UJI: Large complex dataset - our improvements excel

- Deeper architecture handles complexity well

MIXED RESULTS (SOD3):
- Still challenging due to 3-space complexity
- Better than before but not as good as paper
- Need further optimization for multi-space scenarios

CLASSIFICATION:
- Our model designed for regression, not classification
- Paper's classification results are much better
- Need different architecture for classification tasks
