DETAILED IMPROVEMENTS IN FASTERKAN WIFI INDOOR LOCALIZATION IMPLEMENTATION
================================================================================

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of all improvements made to the FasterKAN 
implementation compared to the original paper "Machine Learning-Based WiFi Indoor Localization 
with FasterKAN: Optimizing Communication and Signal Accuracy" (Eng. Sci., 2024, 31, 1289).

================================================================================
1. CRITICAL DATA PREPROCESSING FIXES
================================================================================

1.1 WAP Filtering Correction
---------------------------
ISSUE IN ORIGINAL PAPER:
- The paper claims to reduce WAPs from 520 to 465 by removing "useless APs"
- However, the implementation incorrectly filtered WAPs, keeping all 520 WAPs
- This led to suboptimal performance due to noise from invalid signals

OUR IMPROVEMENT:
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Remove WAPs where ALL values are 100 (invalid)
valid_waps = []
for col in wap_cols:
    if not (df[col] == 100).all():  # Keep if at least one valid value
        valid_waps.append(col)
```

IMPACT:
- Properly filters out completely invalid WAPs
- Reduces noise in the input features
- Improves model training stability and accuracy

1.2 Enhanced Feature Scaling
----------------------------
ORIGINAL APPROACH:
- Used MinMaxScaler for FasterKAN but with suboptimal range handling
- StandardScaler for other models without proper validation

OUR IMPROVEMENT:
- Optimized MinMaxScaler implementation with proper range validation
- Added coordinate transformation for numerical stability
- Implemented proper scaling validation and error checking

1.3 Coordinate Preprocessing Enhancement
---------------------------------------
ORIGINAL ISSUE:
- Large coordinate values caused numerical instability
- No proper coordinate transformation

OUR IMPROVEMENT:
```python
# Transform coordinates to prevent numerical instability
coords_min = coords.min(axis=0)
coords_transformed = coords - coords_min
```

IMPACT:
- Prevents numerical overflow during training
- Improves gradient stability
- Enhances model convergence
